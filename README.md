# Instruction to run our code: 
the easiest way to run our code is using kaggle notebook, because we have 20GB of training data
1. create an kaggle account
2. copy our inference code : https://www.kaggle.com/code/langzhelu/second-sennet-submission?scriptVersionId=154097255

4. then you can either submit the notebook to see the score, or go to sanity check session to see the model's prediction

we run all of our experiments on Kaggle, each training and inference code have different version, the notebook only shows the latest version, but you can check for different version :
